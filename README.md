# Photogrammetry and Gaussian Splatting on Lunar Apollo 17 Imagery

This project explores **Gaussian Splatting for 3D Reconstruction** using Apollo 17 imagery and evaluates how **novel view synthesis** using splatting can enhance **photogrammetric modeling**. The experiment follows a two-part investigation: comparing rendered outputs from splatting with ground truth images and evaluating their utility in improving textured mesh reconstruction.

---

## üìå Objectives

- Train a **Gaussian Splatting model** using a small Apollo 17 image set.
- Generate **novel views** via neural rendering.
- Perform **photogrammetric modeling** using:
  - Original images only (N=15)
  - Augmented dataset with 10 novel views (N=25)
- Conduct **qualitative and quantitative evaluations** using PSNR, SSIM, and mesh visual comparison.

# Workflow Overview

1. **Model Training**  
   -> Used to train the model  

2. **Rendering Trained Outputs**  

   Trained model  
   -> Loads config  
   -> Saves rendered images to `renders/gaussian_images_output`

3. **Quantitative Comparison (PSNR/SSIM)**  
   Rendered images + Ground truth  
   -> Computes PSNR and SSIM  
   -> Outputs metrics


## üõ∞Ô∏è Part B: Novel Views

# Novel View Generation and New Photogrammetry Workflow

1. **Generate Novel Views**  
   Command:  
   `ns-render camera-path --load-config outputs/apollo17-splating/unnamed/splatfacto/<timestamp>/config.yml --output-path renders/novel_views`

   Trained model  
   -> Generates `novel_views.mp4` video of unseen views

2. **Convert Novel Views to Images**  
   Command:  
   `mkdir -p /home/ubuntu/colmap/images3 && ffmpeg -i novel_views.mp4 -vf "select='not(mod(n\\,3))'" -frames:v 10 /home/ubuntu/colmap/images3/novel_%02d.png`

   `novel_views.mp4`  
   -> Extracts every 3rd frame  
   -> Saves 10 images to `colmap/images3/`

3. **New Photogrammetry**  
   Tool: **Agisoft Metashape**

   Original 15 images  
   + 10 novel images  
   -> Reconstructed a new textured mesh  
   -> Standard photogrammetry pipeline used

4. **Novel View Images**

## Qualitative Comparison of Models

| Method                   | Observation                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Original Photogrammetry  | Mesh appears rough with noticeable holes and poor texture coverage from oblique views |
| Augmented with Splatting | Surfaces are more complete, textures align better, and occluded regions are more accurately reconstructed |
